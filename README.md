Discuss how the tree remains balanced after multiple operations and the
impact of balancing on performance: Maintaining a balanced red-black tree helps keep a logarithmic height, meaning that its performance is related to insertion, and search. For example, search time would be the maximum height of a balanced tree which is  2 * log(n). The insertion time would be O(log n).
